# my-first-binder

Welcome to **my-first-binder**! 🎉

This project contains Jupyter notebooks and an environment setup to run them using [Binder](https://mybinder.org). Binder lets you and others run this code **directly in your browser** — no need to install anything!

## 🚀 Launch the Notebooks with Binder

Click the button below to launch this repository in a live, interactive Jupyter environment:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jmurphy172/my-first-binder/HEAD)

---

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `dashboard_test.ipynb` – A notebook for dashboard testing.
- `pdads08_clustering.ipynb` – A clustering notebook, possibly for PDADS data.
- `environment.yml` – Defines the Conda environment needed to run the notebooks.

---

## 🛠 How It Works

Binder reads the `environment.yml` file to create a reproducible environment. It then opens a Jupyter notebook interface where anyone can:

- View the notebooks
- Run the code
- Make their own edits (non-persistent)

---

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

1. Fork or clone this repo if you want to customize.
2. Add any required notebooks or update the `environment.yml` as needed.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
4. Go to [https://mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), paste your GitHub URL, and generate a launch link.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Make sure `environment.yml` is correctly formatted.
- If using pip instead of conda, include a `requirements.txt`.
- You can also specify a Python version using a `runtime.txt` (e.g., `python-3.9`).

Have fun experimenting with your first Binder project! 😊
